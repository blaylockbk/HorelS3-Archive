## Introduction
Pando is an object-storage system at the University of Utah, similar to Amazon Web Services S3. [Pando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_%28tree%29), latin for _I spread_, is named after the vast network of aspen trees in Utah, thought to be the largest and oldest living organism on earth; a fitting name for an archive system.

In January 2017, CHPC allocated the Horel Group 60 TB on the Pando S3 (Simple Storage
Service) archive space and an additional 70 TB in August 2018 for a **total of 130 TB**. This space is leased for a period of 5 years. The archive contains the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model output, GOES-16/17 ABI and GLM data, and some buckets dedicated for testing and exploring the zarr data format.

>### Public access to data on Pando: Refer to the [Accessing Data](./docs/accessing_data_on_pando.md) document.

 > **Pando is experimental:** [Pando failed](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/Pando_archive/Pando_Failure.html) in January 2018, and the entire archive was lost. The archive was rebuilt, old HRRR files were restored, and we continued to archive HRRR and GOES data. We thank [The Climate Corporation](https://climate.com/) for supporting this service through the contribution of their NOAA HRRR archive prior to 2018. Because of them, we restored about 75% of what was lost.

## Mesohorse Pando Responsibilities
`horel-group7` (HG7) is the dedicated home of the Pando archive processing and backup. HG7 contains download scripts, documents, and is the space files are downloaded to before uploaded or "synced" with Pando.

The contents of `horel-group7/Pando/` is the backup for what is on Pando. Note that not everything on Pando is backed up on HG7. This is because HG7 only has 60 TB while our Pando allocation is 130 TB. Older data is removed from HG7 and is not backed up anywhere else. All content in this directory is owned by **mesohorse**. 

The contents of `horel-group7/Pando_Scripts/` includes documents for how Pando works and download scripts. The scripts perform the downloading and syncing of HRRR and GOES files between HG7 and Pando. These documents are owned by **Brian Blaylock**, however, download tasks are performed by **mesohorse**.

Downloads are set up as cron jobs on meso1 by mesohorse.

If you believe you should have mesohorse access, talk to John Horel. To become the mesohorse user, you need to do the following:

    sudo su - mesohorse

In my `.aliases` file, this is set up as an alias, `alias horse 'sudo su - mesohorse'` so that when I type `horse`, it makes me the mesohorse user.

<br>

> Any persons with the Pando access and secret keys can download and upload to Pando. These are necessary in the config files for `rclone` and `s3cmd`.
> Please refer to the [**rclone**](./docs/how_to_rclone.md) and [**s3cmd**](./docs/how_to_s3cmd.md) documents for more info.

Download scripts for the HRRR data. <big>ðŸŒŸ[**README**](./HRRR_downloads/README.md)</big>

### **`Daily_usage/`**
Keeps track of our Pando allocation. Contains a script to compute the daily disk usage on Pando and generates a graphical figure and a new html page with the data. The graphic and webpage is copied to Brian's *public_html* so it can be viewed on the web at http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/Pando_archive/

- `Pando_daily_usage.csh` is the script executed by cron once per day.
- `daily_usage.py` is the python script. This requires python 3 and uses the intall in Brian's home directory.
- `Pando_Space.csv` is a file that contains the Pando disk usage by category type. It is appended each time you run the script `daily_usage.py`. This information is used to make the graphical figure.

### **`rclone-v1.39-linux-386/`**

# ðŸ–Š Archive Management
## HRRR Registration
The HRRR archive registration process is voluntary; users do not have to register to access data (it's just nice to know how many people are using the archive).

The [registration webpage](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr_download_register.html) uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). When someone submits the registration form, the contents of the forum are emailed to atmos-mesowest@lists.utah.edu. I kept an Excel sheet for the first 500 registered users. John Horel has a copy of that Excel sheet.
![](./images/hrrr_users.png)

In the future, it would be nice to not rely on Formspree. I imagine the form would update a `.csv` file and auto generate a new graph to display on the webpage.

## Pando archive usage: How much space is left and when will the S3 archive fill up?
The [Pando Allocation Web Display (PAWD)](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/Pando_archive/) shows the Pando allocation and usage for each bucket. The script that creates this display is run once a day by Brian on meso4 and is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/blaylockbk/Web-Homepage/blob/master/Pando_archive/daily_usage.py).

The script that generates this page runs every morning on `meso4`.
