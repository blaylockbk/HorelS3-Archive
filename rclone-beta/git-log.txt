    Stop --track-renames deleting case folded source files - fixes #1094
    
    What was happening is that when Move was implemented as Copy + Delete,
    MoveFile was seeing the files didn't need transferring (because they
    were identical) then deleted the source.
    
    The fix uses Move instead and patches onedrive to disallow a case
    folded identical copy (which errors with 500 error)

    Re-implement sync routine to work a directory at a time
    
    Multiple directories (up to --checkers worth) are scanned at once.
    
    This uses much less memory than the previous scheme - only the amount
    of memory needed to hold an entire directory listing of objects.
    
    For directory based remotes the speed is unchanged.
    
    For bucket based remotes, instead of doing one API call to list the
    whole bucket, it does multiple calls, one for each pseudo directory.
    However these are done in parallel so in practice this seems to speed
    up directory listings.
    
    This replaces the existing sync method as it performs faster and uses
    less memory.
    
    The old sync method is available with the temporary --old-sync-method
    flag.

    b2: constrain memory usage when doing multipart uploads #439
    
    Each part of a multipart upload takes 96M of memory, so we make sure
    that we don't user more than `--transfers` * 96M of memory buffering
    the multipart uploads.
    
    This has the consequence that some uploads may appear to be at 0% for
    a while, however they will get going eventually so this won't
    re-introduce #731.

    crypt: fix crypt writer getting stuck in a loop #902
    
    This happened when the underlying reader returned io.ErrUnexpectedEOF.
    The error handling for the call to io.ReadFull failed to take this

    io.ErrUnexpectedEOF is reasonably common when SSL connections go wrong
    when communicating with ACD, so it manifested itself as transfers from
    non-encrypted ACD to encrypted ACD getting stuck.

    Define a new Features() method for Fs
    
    Optional interfaces are becoming more important in rclone,
    --track-renames and --backup-dir both rely on them.
    
    Up to this point rclone has used interface upgrades to define optional
    behaviour on Fs objects.  However when one Fs object wraps another it
    is very difficult for this scheme to work accurately.  rclone has
    relied on specific error messages being returned when the interface
    isn't supported - this is unsatisfactory because it means you have to
    call the interface to see whether it is supported.
    
    This change enables accurate detection of optional interfaces by use
    of a Features struct as returned by an obligatory Fs.Features()
    method.  The Features struct contains flags and function pointers
    which can be tested against nil to see whether they can be used.
    
    As a result crypt and hubic can accurately reflect the capabilities of
    the underlying Fs they are wrapping.

    Return error on not found from ListFn
    
    This changes `ListFn`'s implementation so that if it encounters a not
    found error, instead of sending a fatal error to log, it coordinates the
    return of the error between checker goroutines and sends it back to the
    caller.
    
    The main impetus here is that it allows an external program compiling
    against rclone as a package to handle a not found, where it currently it
    cannot.
    
    This does change error output on a not found a little bit, we go from
    this:
    
        2017/01/09 21:14:03 directory not found
    
    To this:

    Add time-based bandwidth limits.
    
    - Change the --bwlimit command line parameter to accept both a limit (as
      before) or a full timetable (formatted as "hh:mm,limit

    - The timetable is checked once a minute by a ticker function. A new

    - This change is compatible with the SIGUSR2 change to toggle bandwidth
      limits.

    sync: Track and perform server-side renames
    
    This commits adds support for tracking of file renames if `track-renames` flag is set,
    and it then performs server-side renames for remotes that support it, i.e.
    remotes that implement either the `Mover` or the `Copier` interface.
    
    Fixes #888
